To slove this , we have developed a system called COLLEGE BUS TRACKING . This system tracks the bus locations and displays their location points in maps and tells 
how much time bus takes to arrive to the destination . 
Here , to develop this we used the components are raspberry pi and GPS module .
this device built into the bus and that tracks the bus location .
and we developed a mobile application to show the bus location points in the maps to all the users .
and to communicate location data , we use a server in between mobile application and GPS devise .
the server we have used is FireBase by GOOGLE .
Students can download application with free - of - cost and install in their devises
and can see the bus location in the mobile application linked with this tracking system .
this system definitely solve the problem .

THE idea is to know the students of their location of thier college bus in their mobile device .
we have built this prototype and have tested the device in real time .
and with this device we present the idea with college buses .
and we are planing to launch our MVP ()
